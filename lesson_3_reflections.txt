When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  When you plan to share your work and/or collaborate on a project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not be ready to publish. By manually pushing, you ensure that
    what is shared is material you're ready to share.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is initially a copy of repository that you intend to alter and
    experiment with with the hope of later merging with the Master or some other
    branch. Cloning just copies an existing repository that you may or may not
    wish to add to and create as your own. Forking is basically cloning, but
    performed within Github as a shortcut so that you don't have to go through
    the process of creating a remote.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This way, if you stop working for a while, you can easily track all of the
    changes to the remote that were made while you were offline.
