What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  You create a repository that contains whatever files currently exist in your
  directory. This is created so that you can now begin to track the different
  changes you make to your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area gives the developer a chance to add or subtract files before
  making the commit. He/She might change their minds about what they want to
  include as they work.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  You can compare your changes between the working directory and the staging
  area to see the differences, if there are any. Then you have the option of
  adding or removing files from the staging area before committing.
